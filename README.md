# Mini-Aevol : A mini-application based on the Aevol simulator

A reduced version (from a model and implementation point of view) of Aevol.

DO NOT USE IT TO SIMULATE BIOLOGICAL RESULTS ! See [http://www.aevol.fr](http://www.aevol.fr) for that !

It must be used only to test HPC optimization of the code (parallel, vector, porting to new architecture...).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
First, you will need to install zlib (and its headers).
You also need to compile the given SFMT library (that manage the PRNG).

```
cd SFMT-src-1.4
cmake .
make
```

### Compilation

The compilation is straightforward

```
cmake .
make
```

It will produced the executable pdc_mini_aevol.

## Running a simulation

A help (-e or --help) is given to explain the different parameters.

Basically, you must create a directory to store the simulation files (backup/checkpointing and stats files) and then run the simulation
```
mkdir simulation_example_1
cd simulation_example_1
../pdc_mini_aevol
```

You can also resume a simulation from a backup/checkpointing file (for example, resuming from the generation 1000):
```
cd simulation_example_1
../pdc_mini_aevol -r 1000
```

## Model and Implementation
